# Exploratory Data Analysis on the PISA2012 Dataset

## Dataset

The PISA2012 consists of information on 485,490 students, with features such as their country and scores in Math, Science and Reading tests. 
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisa2012.csv.zip&sa=D&ust=1581581520574000),
with feature documentation available to download [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisadict2012.csv&sa=D&ust=1554482573645000).


## Summary of Findings

1. Science had the highest average score of 475.8, followed by Reading with 472, and Math with the lowest average of 469.6
2. Africa and the Middle East had the lowest participation for the PISA study
3. The students were almost equally split by gender, with 49.52% of the students being Male and the remaining 50.48% of the students female.

8. Students from OECD countries scored a total of 144 points more than students who are in non-OECD countries.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on how the students gender influenced their scores. 
I started by showing the percentage of male and female students in the study.
I then showed the distribution of all three subjects by gender

Afterwards, I showed the percentage of OECD and non-OECD countries in the dataset,
then I showed a world map of OECD and non-OECD countries.

I finally showed a world map of the students total combined scores in the pisa Science, Math and Reading tests.
